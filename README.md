# SimplyTasks

Our objective was to build a easy to use and good looking task manager application using React and a backend solution. For the backend we chose to use Firebase.

## Features include:

- Adding Tasks
- Removing Tasks
- Highlighting Tasks
- Sorting Tasks
- Viewing Tasks in Calendar format with heatmap
- Arrange Tasks manually by dragging and dropping
